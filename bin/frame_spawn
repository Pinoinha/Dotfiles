# The script compares the number of opened windows in the focused tiling frame, and then compares:
# 1) If the frame is not empty (!= 0), then it wll be split vertically by a ratio of 0.5 \
# and the application will be opened in the new, empty frame
# 2) If the frame is empty, then the application will simply be spawned on it.
