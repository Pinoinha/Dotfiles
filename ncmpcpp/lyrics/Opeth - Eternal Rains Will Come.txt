Eternal rains will come
We should say goodbye
And suffer on our own
As all our thoughts were wrong

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
When the flood comes to drown us
There's nothing we can do

You told me not to wait
Unless I could wait forever
Because there's no time for us
Take comfort in what was

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
When the flood comes to drown us
There's nothing we can do

Here it comes
Our death comes
And in my sleep
I can't forget

Reaching for the surface, I see you
